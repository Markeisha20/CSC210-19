CSC210 Data Structures Fall 2019

This repository will be used to distribute lab assignments and their solutions. If you are inspired, you can learn how to use the full power of Github by downloading git onto your machine and cloning the repository. However, you can limit your use of Git to this web interface. If you want to download the files, click on the Clone or Download button and choose to download. All files will be downloaded every time you click on this button. If you clone the repo, you can _pull_ from the repo and grab only those elements that have changed since the last time you pulled from the repo. There are great resources on Git and GitHub. You can start here at my Git page from when I was at UMN. Some of it only pertains to UMN's enterprise version, but there is a lot there for the public version of Git and GitHub: <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lars1050/repo-website-resources/website/examples/csresources/git.html" target="_blank">Larson Git Reference Page</a>.
