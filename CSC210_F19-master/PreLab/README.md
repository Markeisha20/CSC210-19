Create a Driver Class program in Java that will test every method in the source files from Objects.zip.  You'll probably want to start by calling the constructors to build new Fiction and NonFiction objects.  Then you can use getters and setters along with print statements to check/verify that the data is correctly storing and/or updating information.

Create a _Car_ Class that will run correctly with the _Driver_ class program provided below.  Also note that there is a UML Diagram for your Object Class provided.

Helpful hints:

- The provided Driver.java file has a good example of how to test code. You can use it as a model for your code.

- You can use your terminal program to run command line tools. Some people find the command line tools nicer to work with than the GUI tools. If you are interested in these, the below two links may be of interest for you.
